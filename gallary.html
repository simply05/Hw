					<div>Description:The reason why I decided to pick myself to be in a forest is because of the fact that I like going camping allot and seeing the animals
						in their natural habitat hence the bear and dear and eagle. I believe they also represent myself for showing I like to be calm and also be true like how
						nature is untouched by mankind. My main inspiration for putting the animals is from prior experiences and experiences I would like to have. For example,
						I have seen bears and eagles but I havenâ€™t yet seen a deer. The most challenging part of this project for me was making the animals and my self the right
						size in the background. I  fix it by making my self in front and putting the animals small in the background as if they were in the distance from where I was.

						is a reference to my last project when i was in the forest. the hardest part of this project was the making of the hair because i tried to make it with shapes

					<div class =  "floatingleft">The place of the story is at the main character's house. I combine 6 different audio samples. For the effects that I use I used the distortion effect in order
						to get the devil voice, I wanted to get. Then I used an equalizer and noise reduction to make the none effect voices cleaner. This is because where I did the voices
						my computer made a loud noise so I had to remove it and then I clean out the voices to make it clearer. The most challenging part was saving the  audio in the right
						place because one time I accidentally deleted the whole project and had to redo it.
